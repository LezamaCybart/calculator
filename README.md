This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum: (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator) on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. \

Live Demo: https://lezamacybart.github.io/calculator/ \

Functionality: \
*Basic operations: Add, substract, multiply and divide \
*Clear button that clears the screen. \
*Backspace so that the user can undo. \
*It operates with floating numbers. \
*Has keyboard support. \
*Rounds the numbers so they don't overflow the screen. \
*Gives feedback to the user when trying to do operations that could break the program ( dividing by 0, pressing "=" without giving all the parameters ). \

Thoughts: \
It was definitely the hardest project so far. Figuring it out the logic behind the basic functionality took some time, and the I had to keep\
changing it up when adding extra functionalities. It all ended up working at the end, which is good, but once I am more comfortable\ with JavaScript I want to come back and refactor the code so it implements the app's functionality in a more efficient way.\
